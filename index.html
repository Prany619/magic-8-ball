<h2>Welcome to the Magic 8 Ball Game! 🎱</h2>
<p>Got a question on your mind? Maybe you're wondering if you’ll ace that test, if pizza is the right choice for dinner (spoiler: it always is), or if you should text your crush? Well, this magical ball has all the answers you need—sort of.</p>
<p>Use the magic 8-ball to discover the answers to all your questions</p>

        <h2>How to play: </h2>
        <p>Here’s how it works: Once you press play, you’ll see the iconic Magic 8 Ball on your screen, waiting for your question. Inside, the number "8" will stare back at you, just like the classic toy. When you're ready, type in  your yes-or-no question and hit the Shake the Magic 8 Ball button</p>
        <p>As the ball shakes, the number "8" will vanish, and your answer will appear, chosen randomly from its mystical list of possibilities. Will it say "It is certain," or will it leave you hanging with "Ask again later"? The only way to find out is to play.</p>
        <p>So, go ahead, give it a try! Think of your question, shake the ball, and let fate decide your destiny. Have fun, and remember: the Magic 8 Ball is always right</p>
